# DiscordBott
  It's simple, this is a Bot. 
  Nothing here to change the world, nothing to reinvent programming itself.
  Just a simple Bot, not even meant for public use, i mean you could, but who in the world would even do that, after all, its just something 
  to learn stuff. That will probably change after im done with learning the Basics, but let's see first before i promise anything.
 
# Why DiscordBott 
  Well, there's no reason to use it at all, so just don't. If you want to go ahead, just don't say you made it.
 
# Why not DiscordBott
  Now for that, there are many reasons. There are Bots that are much better than this one, easier to use, more advanced, polished. Here, i'll even recommend
  you one, it's called Nyria, but before you go on the Google and search for it, i'll give you the link, because there's also another DC bot called Nyria
  which is only based on Cryptotrading, and we don't do that here. [Click here to get to the true Nyria](https://github.com/Nyria-Discord)
 
# End Word
  So basicaly, don't use this Bot, there are better ones.
